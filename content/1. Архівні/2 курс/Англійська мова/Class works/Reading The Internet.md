Dear redaction of the "День за днем", you are doing a great job, creating an interesting newspaper every week. You have different variants of reading the newspaper, one of them is – the regular paper variant. As a reader interested in the technical nuances of the surrounding world I wonder how the process of creating a newspaper works. What I want to ask exactly is what software and hardware you are using for work. Is it a very specific professional software, or something closer to what the general public use? Also what machines are used to produce newspapers? If you can please share some characteristics and models. Thanks for your attention.
