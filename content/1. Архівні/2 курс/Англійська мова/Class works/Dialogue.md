# Dialogue about monitors
-- Hello, I'd like to buy a monitor for programming and watching movies.

— Hello, what is your budget?

-- My budget is up to 20000 UAH.

— In this price category, I can recommend monitors from such brands as Acer, Lenovo, HP, Dell, and Samsung. How many inches do you want the monitor to be?

-- I would like a wide monitor of 24 to 26 inches.

— Well, I can recommend you this monitor from Lenovo, Samsung Odysey, and Acer Nitro. 

-- What's the difference between them?

— All these monitors have the same type of panel - IPS. They have different resolutions and refresh rates.

-- Of the monitors you recommended, I was most interested in the Lenovo monitor. 

— This monitor is not bad, but I advise you to consider more expensive options, because they have much better characteristics. For example, Samsung Odyssey. It has a higher refresh rate, and Samsung is one of the world's leading manufacturers of monitors.

-- What are the advantages of a higher refresh rate?

— The standard refresh rate is 60 hertz. Some monitors have a higher refresh rate. With a higher refresh rate, you get a much better experience with the operating system and you also get an advantage in multiplayer games.

-- You've tried the Acer Nitro and the Samsung Odysey. What is the difference between their refresh rates?

— The Acer Nitro has a 144Hz refresh rate, while the Samsung Odysey has a 240Hz refresh rate. We can show you these 2 monitors in action so you can better understand which one is right for you.

*Max is high on monitors 

— Also, the Samsung Odysey has a higher resolution, namely 4k, not 1440p.

-- I didn't notice much difference in smoothness between the Samsung Odysey and the Acer Nitro.

— Would you consider buying the Acer Nitro?

-- Yes, considering the price and quality.

— Well, let's go to the checkout and make your purchase.

-- What about the warranty?

— We have a standard one-year warranty on the monitor, and the monitor is subject to warranty repair or exchange if it has no mechanical damage or signs of moisture inside.

-- Thank you for your help, goodbye.

— Nay serve, come back again, goodbye.
