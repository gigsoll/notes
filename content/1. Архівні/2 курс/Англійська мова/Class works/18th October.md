# Task 25

Web browsers are a type of software widely used by all types of users. Web browser is a very important type of software. No matter who you are – beginner home user, student, developer or power user. Nowadays, people spend most of the time in it while uses their computers. This type of software provides ability to access various web pages and web apps. This helps covers different needs of computer users. Web brother software is very helpful for me, and it is an integral part of my workflow. I use it for study, relax and for work with AI. Modern web browsers provides huge variety of tools. The main and most obvious feature of a web browser is the ability to browse the web. The list of additional features heavily depend on what particular browser you use. The main features, what can be found in all main stream web browsers, are: 
1. Extensions 
2. UI customization 
3. Web apps
4. Privacy features All of it is very useful, so lest briefly look at all of it using Firefox as an example.
## Extensions
Modern web is very destructive, full of advertisement and annoying popups. Extensions what can be installed by users solve this problem. It can remove ad and annoying popups from websites, upgrade your privacy and add additional tools for you. As mention before – extension are very simple to install. In Firefox, you can install it in extension platform called [Mozilla add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/uk/firefox/). You can visit this site and install any of them in touch of the button.
## UI customization
In my opinion, customization of the interface is very important for computer users. In the world where the outfit of our devices is basically the same – the only way to be not a gray mass is to make software what you use as personalized as possible. It isn't just for beauty, it helps you be more productive and happy when you interact with your computer. Firefox provides a huge amount of customization for its users. They can customize appears of top panel and what instruments will be on it, customize homepage, use color schemes created by community and install extensions what can help to upgrade the look of the web browser. Also, some users who want to go deeper in customization habit hole can create a custom CSS files. This can radically change the look and behavior of Firefox.
## Web apps
In 2007 Steve Jobs believe than on phones all can be done with web apps. He wasn't true about it, but in PC world it is another case. Think how often you open your web browser just to visit one or two special websites. It can be everything from YouTube to specialized sites for math or geoanalisiz. Modern web browsers can install your favorite websites on your PC. After this incredibly simple process, you can run they from your Start menu as regular apps in separated windows. ## Privacy features In modern word, privacy is very important for everyone. We have an amazing quote about it

> If you don't pay for the product then you are the product.

Big tech companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc. constantly collect data about our behaviors, system configuration, search and visiting history and long list of another info. Why they do it? They do it to create our electronic fingerprint. You may ask: What is this electronic fingerprint? Electronic fingerprints are special markers what pins to us to identify us to sell more relevant advertisement. So when we know this information, it will be clear to understand why privacy is so important – no one wants to be a product to sell. One of the main ideas and key advantages of Firefox web browser is privacy. Mozilla constantly works to add more and more security to our lives. So now we have these privacy features:

- Secure email generation – Firefox generate random email address for different websites, what you can use to confuse trackers and make you less vulnerable to hackers attacks.
- Password generation – your web browser generates random and secure password every time when you register on new sites and safe it to build in password manager.
- Spoofing IP address – Firefox can spoof your IP address to stop trackers from identifying you with the same IP acres.
- Websites containerization – another great feature what make possible running suspicious websites like [facebook.com](facebook.com), [instagram.com](instagram.com), [amazon.com](amazon.com) etc. in containers. This makes these websites no longer available to collect all the data about you to sell ad, This is main features what can make you feel more safe in modern web.
# Task 26
## Question 1
Yes, I modify some programs to make it feels and looks better for me. I was modified Firefox web browser with custom CSS. This file completely reworks the panel with tabs and instruments. You can see the concept on these changes on this concept picture. The most challenging part of it was creating of design concept and learning of CSS and troubleshooting. ![](https://i.imgur.com/kvWVaAP.png) Also, I was created custom color scheme for [excalith-start-page](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page). I was created it for me and post screenshot on Reddit. Author of this start page saw it and ask me about color scheme to add this to git repository. Now you can find my color scheme with name verdant.json. I am very proud about it.
## Question 2
In my opinion the most interesting part of software – software what can be controlled by your mind. So if I will be the best programmer, I would pay my attention for this kind of software
## Question 3
Writing instruction for the computer is easier and harder at the same time. It is easier because computer execute your commands without any question and refusal. It is harder because all instruction for computer must be perfectly written without paradoxes and errors.
# Task 27
In this text I will show you different apps what can be used for image editing by everyone completely free and on any operating system. Before this, let's define some basics. This text is only about raster image editors and only about free and open source image editors. We will look on such programs like GIMP, Krita and Pinta.
## Pinta
Let's start our text with the less professional, but very simple image editor called Pinta. This image editor isn't concurrent for programs like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, but it is a great alternative for Microsoft Paint. In comparing with it, Pinta have reacher functional and user-friendly user interface. It provides simple tools such as pen, brush, rectangle, square and selection. In addition to them, this image editor have bonus features like layers and advanced color picker. It can be a great application to use by non-pro users to simple image editing. 
## Krita
Next app what we will look on is Krita. This free and open source app is heavily used in illustration and animation by different artists. It has a bit harder interface compare with Pinta, but have better functionality. The main advantage of Krita is its brush collection. I am not expert in illustration, so I am shocked by collection of brushes ant settings for it. You can choose virtual brush, set its size, color, intercity and another characteristic what is very helpful for artist. Also, Krita have layers with masks and filters support and instruments to create simple geometrical objects.
## GIMP
The last image editor what we will look on is GIMP. Every time when someone asks about free alternative for Photoshop – everyone speak about it. And this discussion have reasons. GIMP can perform 95% of all Photoshop features in very similar way, so users can with to it if they want to do it. For someone who wants to switch exist some extension called PhotoGIMP what can make your photo editor looks and feel completely like Adobe Photoshop. It has active developers who fix bugs and adds features, what is great because your editor never stuck in place and constantly upgrades. Another great advantages of GIMP is community support. You can ask any question about this editor on [r/gimp](reddit.com/r/gimp), and you will get helpful answers by users what is more professional than you.
## Final words
As you can see – even you don't want to pay money and want open source photo editing app, you can find it now. With some learning, you will make every raster image what you can imagine. Remember – not matter what software you use, because it is just an instrument, really matter who uses this software.
