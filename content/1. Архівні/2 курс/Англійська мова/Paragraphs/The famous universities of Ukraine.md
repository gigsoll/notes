# The famous universities of Ukraine
Acording to wikipedia Ukraine has 1,6 million people with higther education. This is huge amount of people, what means that all this people must study in some places. So in this speech we going to speak about 3 greatest and most known universities of Ukraine. This universes were chosed based on my personal expirience, and it means than this is pretty subjective speech.

First Universe about I want to speak is Lvivska Politechnica. This higther education institution was created in 1816 and train famous ukrainian nationalists the most known are Roman Shuhevych and Stepan Bandera. Lviv is beutiful city and I dream to come here one day. I was my motivation letter to this university to specialty number 122 but not to the greatest part of this specialty. I was know that i cant passthrougth here so place this univercity in 4 position.

Next University is NAU or National Aviation Univercity. Why i chose this universe as variant? First of all because it is one of the Kiyvs HEIs that i can enter with my NMT results. I was chosed specialty number 113 Applied math if speaking in human language. Trutly, applied math isnt the best specialty, so I give this university second prioridy and send my motivation letter.

So and last University about i want to speak is Vinitsia National Technical University also known as VNTU. As you can see and hear I am here. So why I am here? This is multiple reasons. First of all because this is one of the few universities in Ukraine with a quality education in systems analysis. This spesialty is great balance between math base and practical programming. Secondary reason is my family membership that lives in surrounding village. And finaly because Vinitsia is beatiful city with great architecture and infrastracture. So i place my aplication for membership with first priority. I am here now because i make this choise this summer. I am really happy to be here because I have great group, huge amount of new datings and pretty great and solid education.
