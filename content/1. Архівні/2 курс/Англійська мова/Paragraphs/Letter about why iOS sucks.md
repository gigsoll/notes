Hello Dima,

It is a bit strange that I write you a letter instead of DMing in Telegram, but a topic of this importance requires to be separated letter.

As I know, you're planing to buy an iPhone. If it is correct – stop now, because it is a very bad decision. Now I will explain to you why. So firstly, iPhone is bad as technical device because you pay much more for brand, than for specs. In the same price you can get much better phone. Looks for example in OnePlus or Google Pixel. There are amazing phones. They have better specs and much more interesting and customizable OS. And all this for lower price. OK, I can understand that you like design and video shooting quality, but iOS ruin this all advantages.

I used iOS in the past, and it wasn't a great experience for me. Let's look at the main difference between it and Android. Firstly, it is the ability to choose. On Android, you can install external launcher. It can change the whole experience of your interaction with your phone. On Android, you can change icon packs, create custom widgets and set animated wallpapers. Yes, on latest releases of iOS customization is beat better than was, but is not the same as it is on Android.

Next what we going to look is application ecosystem. And u might say – "But iOS have amazing apps", and in some form you will right, but not. On iOS, u can install apps only from one source and it is App Store. That means that you're unable to install your favorite open source apps and cracked versions of programs. Dima, are you ready to pay $5 a month just to listen to music on Spotify?! Probably, no. Also, new changes in Material you design makes Android looks much more clean, modern and interesting than iOS. Your operating system now adapts to your wallpapers.

OMG, I get a flashback about file downloading on iOS. It is real pain. You can't just start download your files and leave your phone to do it. In one moment, it magically stops doing their work and go to sleep, to save 0.1% of battery. And you can't deal with it. In Android, you can turn off battery optimization for a specific app. You can't download torrent, you can't open RAR files, you can't install custom file explorer. Did you send your photos to a PC via UBS? Forget about this. On iPhone, you can't simply plug in your phone and send your photos to a pc. You should use iCloud

And the last about I want to speak is ECOSYSTEM. Every technical blogger speaks about it, but is it an advantage for you? Dima, you don't have any another Apple device to feel this. If u really wants Apple magic, u should buy Mac, iPad and AirPods. Without all this stuff, you just have limited phone. If u really wants to have something similar to ecosystem – you can simply install KDE connect on your phone.

So basically, buy iPhone, or not – it is your own decision. I am not recommended you to buy this phone. But all this text is just my opinion. DM me in telegram if you disagree with something, or want to talk about this topic.
