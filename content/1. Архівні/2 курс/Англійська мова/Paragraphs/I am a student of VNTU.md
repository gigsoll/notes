# I am a student of VNTU
I am a student of Vinnytsia National Technical University.  This year, admission to the university was unusual because of the Russian invasion   in Ukraine. Therefore, I had to take NMT (National Multisubject test). There was no choice, so I passed exams of Ukrainian language, mathematics and history of Ukraine.

 For the last two years, I have been interested in computers, so this was the main reason why I chose system analysisas my spicialisation. This specialty allows you to understand how computers work and learn new technologies that expand the possibilities of using computers in various fields.

 At university, I liked programming and algorithmic languages ​​the most.  In this subject, we study various programming languages ​​and algorithms used in computer systems.  This subject gives me the opportunity to develop my programming skills and make my own projects.

 In our group there are many interesting and intelligent people who are always ready to help each other.  We learn together, develop skills and share experiences.  Our teachers are always ready to help and support us to gain maximum knowledge and skills.

 At the Vinnytsia National Technical University, I get a quality education, develop my skills and get to know the world of computer technologies.  I am glad that I chose this educational institution and the specialty that allows me to realize my potential.
