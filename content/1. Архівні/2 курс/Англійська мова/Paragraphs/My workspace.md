# Introduction
My workplace is not very interesting. It has simple wooden chair and table. I can't say anything interesting about my workspace. The chair has no adjustments in height or angle of back. On the desk, I have a simple pen holder and my laptop. So if my real world workspace is boring, I will speak about my set-up on laptop.
My laptop – is my main work instrument and workspace. Here I have my all my applications and desktop settings. So in this text I want to speak about how I set up my virtual workspace.
# Operating System
In the modern world, we have three main operating systems – Windows, macOS and Linux. On my computer, It is possible to install only two of them – Windows and Linux. Most of my life, I was a Windows user, but in the last 1,5 years I am running Linux as my main operating system. It is a modern and free open source operating system. Main advantages for me are:
- high customizability
- wide verity of distributions
- ease of software management
- active system development
- better performance
All these are essential for me, so it is my choice.
# Desktop environment
On the Linux, we have different applications, what are used as a desktop. Every project provides a different experience and way of interaction with a computer. For example, Gnome desktop environment as a main point has beauty and ease of use. But I am using KDE plasma.
> Simple by default, powerful when needet

It is a main idea of this project. By default, the desktop looks like Windows, but can be changed to anything.
## Panels
I have a two panel set-up. The first panel is on the top of a display and second one – on the left border. The main is top panel. It is always shown and contains all widgets what I want to my work. Here is a list of widgets from left to right.
1. Color peaker – this widget allows me to pick color from any pixel on a screen. Also, it provides me a list of the last selected colors.
2. Menu widget – provides access to a menu of application. For example – in the GIMP (photo editor) I can access to a menu bar right on my top panel. It is very useful because it saves vertical space on a screen. This is important in a laptop with a small display.
3. Clock widget – it is a clock with seconds and ability to access a calendar, weather and timers.
4. Folders – there are my most used folders (screenshots, videos, downloads and documents). I can access files from those directories without opening a file explorer.
5. ChatGPT widget – use it as my assistant on the computer.
6. System tray – simple system tray.
The left panel is much simpler. The main point of it is – displaying of currently opened apps.
## Visual adjustments
I love when my desktop looks clean and minimalistic. I want to have a minimal number of icons on it and apps what adapts to my wallpapers. KDE Plasma provides me all instruments to do it. I was installed animated wallpapers, to make my desktop more interesting. Also, I customize windows buttons. I remove maximize and minimize buttons because for me. They are useless, because my workflow moving around virtual desktops, instead of windows.
## Krunner
In the part of the text where I talk about panels – you may see that I have no "Start" menu. And it is true. When I was a Windows user – I use "Start" menu to type a name of an application and run it. KDE Plasma have amazing tool called krunner, what do this and much more. It can search not only applications, but different parts of system. It searches files, folders, websites and system settings. Also, krunner can make calculations and transform measurements. This part of the system is essential for me. For me, it is much faster to open krunner and type first part of application name, than to make it with mouse.
# Obsidian
The Second essential part of my virtual workspace is Obsidian – my text editor. It is much more than a simple text editor. In comparing with real workspace – it is calendar, notepad, spreadsheet and telegraph in one place. I have multiple plugins here to make it more useful for me. Here I take my study notes, plan tasks, publish notes to my website and take daily notes. It is very big part of my workflow, what make me more productive and make me organized. It is very powerful and require separated text to describe all usage of it. This part of the text is just a simple consumption.
