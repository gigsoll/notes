The article explores the use of open-source software in educational institutions. Its advantages and disadvantages in the education process. During the proces of research was found the main advantages such as: lover cost, philisophical reasons, better support, flexibility and security. Also was highlithed the main disadvantages of Open Source software what stops it further implementation in educational institutions.

# Introduction
This paper emphasizes the main advantages and disadvantages of Open Source software. In article is disquased different aspects of why  this type of software can be usefull in schools and univercities and what is the main factors what stops this transition to open sorce software.
# Research results
Open-source software is software with code available to view, explore, and modify. Based on this software, you can create modifications, fix errors create new software. Another term is very often used to characterize software systems - free software. The definitions of open and free software are not the same, but they are close. The source codes of open programs are released either as public domain or under "free" licenses such as GNU - General Public License or BSD License. A free license allows you to use the source code of the program for any needs with minimal restrictions that do not contradict the definition of "Open-Source. Schools have a social mission: to teach students to be citizens of a strong, capable, independent, cooperating, and free society. They should promote the use of free software just as they promote conservation and voting. By teaching students free software, they can graduate citizens ready to live in a free digital society. Open source software is free by nature and can be much easier adapted to different methods of study for every student.
**Advantages of Open Sorce software**
a) Cost. It is the first and most obvious advantage. With the rising price of proprietary software and its associated license fees, one of the primary strengths of Open Sources is its low cost of entry.
b) Pedagogy. The whole philosophy of Open Source fosters the concepts of sharing, collaboration, the common good, and quality of products. According to Herbert Malcolm in his work "Open Source in Education: An Overview": "It is far better to teach the concepts behind word-processing than it is to teach a particular program".
c) Support. Open Source applications can be supported in the same ways as traditional soft- ware, and this is becoming more widely available.
d) Flexibility. Unlike closed-source software, it is far easier to change to a different application with Open Source software.
e) Security. With the source code openly available for inspection by the community, vulnerabilities are quickly identified and addressed. The collaborative effort in the FOSS community ensures a faster response to security threats, fostering a robust and continuously improving security environment.
**Disadvantages of Open Sorce software**
a) Anyone can view souce code. The source code is available to any user, that is, anyone can find vulnerabilities and errors in the software product and use them for their own purposes (but this option is quite rare)
b) Some software is one person projects. Very often Open Source project is created by one person as the personal project and grow to such a big scale than original maintainer is unable to continue to maintain project.
c) Development divercity. Development of one program in fundamentally different directions - cases when developments are so different that it becomes impossible to combine modules.
# Conclusions
Open Source software refers to programs and applications that have source code that is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software freely.
The paper discusses several potential benefits of adopting Open Source software in educational settings. One major advantage is that Open Source software is typically free or very low cost to obtain and use. This can allow schools and universities with limited budgets to access high-quality software and IT infrastructure without expensive licensing fees. Additionally, having full access to the source code allows for greater customizability, security auditing, and community support. Educators and students can modify Open Source programs to meet their specific needs. And a global community of developers contributes improvements and fixes bugs with Open Source programs.
However, the paper also notes there are challenges to the widespread adoption of Open Source software in schools. One is that transitioning from current proprietary software and systems requires significant initial investment of time, money, and technical expertise. Most educators are also more familiar and comfortable with existing commercial software options. There may also be concerns about documentation, support# Abstract
